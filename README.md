# Fundamental Project: Inventory Management System

This is my project for the Inventory Management System. This showcases the skills I have gained over the last 5 weeks with QA Academy.
This program was written in Java, and the database was created and stored in MySQL, which was then connected and transported into Java. The IMS allows users to perform basic CRUD functionality. After an order is placed, the system provides an Items ID, Quantity, and Total Cost.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
- Java 8 JDK
- Maven
- MySQL Version 8 or higher
- Git
- JUnit

```

### Installing

1. Clone this repository

```
 git clone https://github.com/malikster123/Software-Core-Fundamental-Project.git
```
2. inside your terminal run: 
```cd ims mvn java -jar```
This will result in an executable .jar file that can be run by the JVM.
Open the project in your IDE of choice (the project was developed in Eclipse).

Once built and opened, the application can be used to manipulate the database. First, select a table to perform operations on. Then, select the operation. The application will ask for information and manipulate the database accordingly.
